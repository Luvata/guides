## Backpropagation
According to [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation) :
>- Backpropagation is a method used in artificial neural networks to calculate the error contribution of each neuron after a batch of data (in image recognition, multiple images) is processed. This is used by an enveloping optimization algorithm to adjust the weight of each neuron, completing the learning process for that case.
